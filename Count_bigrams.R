# Reads the file
# Applies the following pipepline, by processing groups of N lines 
# - Reads N lines
# - Replaces all punctuations by spaces
# - Converts all characters to lowercase
# - Anything between spaces is a token
# - Replaces any "bad word" token with a space (and increments bad-word count)
# - Add each token to the overall token set
# - Outputs the token set when all lines have been consumed
# Later
# - creates 2-grams and 3-grams with counts so that we can create probabilities

# Punctuation characters: ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~.
